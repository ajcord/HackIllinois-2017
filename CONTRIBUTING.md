3. Send a pull request via GitHub

Your pull request should reference a bug or feature request so that
the motivation behind it is clear.
If the pull request is rejected for some reason,
keep in mind that it's not personal.
Just make the requested changes and resubmit.

## How to report a bug
* Bugs should contain the following information:
    - Brief summary
    - Specific, minimal set of instructions to reproduce the bug
    - Expected results
    - Actual results
    - How often the bug occurs
    - How important it is. Use the following classification:
        - Show-stopper: the game is unusable and cannot be shipped as-is
        - Crash: the game crashes for any reason
        - Minor bug: needs to get fixed at some point
        - Annoyance: not a bug, but something that you want to get fixed
        - Enhancement: new non-core functionality
    - Error messages
    - Any other supporting information (e.g. workarounds)
* First bugs for Contributors
  * Submit annoyance or minor bugs first to learn the procedure for reporting
  * Start by fixing minor bugs that only require one or two changes
