keep in mind that it's not personal.
Just make the requested changes and resubmit.

## How to report a bug
* Bugs should contain the following information:
    - Brief summary
    - Specific, minimal set of instructions to reproduce the bug
    - Expected results
    - Actual results
    - How often the bug occurs
    - How important it is. Use the following classification:
        - Show-stopper: the game is unusable and cannot be shipped as-is
        - Crash: the game crashes for any reason
        - Minor bug: needs to get fixed at some point
        - Annoyance: not a bug, but something that you want to get fixed
        - Enhancement: new non-core functionality
    - Error messages
    - Any other supporting information (e.g. workarounds)
* First bugs for Contributors
  * Submit annoyance or minor bugs first to learn the procedure for reporting
